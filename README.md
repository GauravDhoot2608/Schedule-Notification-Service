# Schedule-Notification-Service
## Scheduled Notification Service
You are tasked with developing a backend service for sending scheduled notifications to users. The service should allow users to schedule notifications for specific dates and times, and it should deliver these notifications to users via email or push notifications. The backend system should provide the following functionality:
### User Authentication:
  Authentication tokens should be used to authenticate API requests.
### Notification Scheduling:
* Users should be able to schedule notifications for specific dates and times.
* Notifications can be one-time or recurring (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
* Users should be able to specify the content and delivery method (email, push notification) for each notification.
* Users should be able to view, edit, and delete scheduled notifications.
* Provide functionality to cancel or reschedule notifications if needed.
### Notification Delivery:
* Implement a mechanism to deliver notifications to users at the scheduled date and time.
* Support for email and push notification delivery methods.
* Ensure that notifications are sent reliably and on time.
